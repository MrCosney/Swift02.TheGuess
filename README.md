# The Guess

This is my adaptation of Hangman Game. This is a paper and pen word game where you have to guess the right term. Itâ€™s a perfect game to get to know new or uncommon words.
This version of the game features 3 word themes:
- **Capitals**
- **Auto Brands**
- **Pokemons**

## Interface
The interface is very simple and intuitive. 
 - **Settings Menu**: *here you can turn on/off background music and button sounds.*
 - **Theme Selection Menu**: *Here you can choose the theme of the words to play.*
 - **Complexity Selection Menu**: *here you can choose the complexity of the game (This will affect the number of guess attempts).*

## Game Process
Depending on the complexity of the game, you will have a limited number of attempts to guess the word (7/6/5).
- **For each misguided letter, 1 doodle will disappear from the screen**.
- **Be careful, the last Doodle is very afraid to be alone!**
